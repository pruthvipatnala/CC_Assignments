201 - The HTTP 201 Created success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a resource.
204 - The server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body.
400 - 400 Bad Request response status code indicates that the server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
405 -  405 Method Not Allowed response status code indicates that the request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource.
