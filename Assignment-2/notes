1) Diff b/w resource and end point .
Ans : In REST, the resource typically refers to some object or set of objects that are exposed at an API endpoint. /api/users/johnny. An endpoint by itself is just a reference to a uri that accepts web requests that may or may not be RESTful.

2) What is an URI ?
Ans : REST APIs use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to address resources.

Ans : 

200 - The HTTP 200 OK success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded.
201 - The HTTP 201 Created success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a resource.
204 - The server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body.
400 - 400 Bad Request response status code indicates that the server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
405 -  405 Method Not Allowed response status code indicates that the request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource.
413 - The HTTP 413 Payload Too Large response status code indicates that the request entity is larger than limits defined by server; the server might close the connection or return a Retry-After header field.
